        Hi, we're Lemonade Stand! We were founded in 2018 by Libby Davis. We're a
        company focused on helping students with small businesses. It can be
        anything; from a small dog-walking or photography business or an idea to
        create a tech company or clothing store! We're here to help you find
        customers and supporters so that you can really kick off and focus on the
        more interesting parts of your business like the actual product!
